    <div class="text">
      <p>For all who choose to participate, welcome to TIME FAULT. A dystopian modern-day / near-future D&D campaign, hosted by yours truly. </p>
      <p>First, some explanation for those who are unaware. The "Days Left" channel in the Booty Grabbers discord server was a delivery path for my ARG (Alternate Reality Game) that, over time, would drop lore hints for this upcoming campaign.</p>
	  <p>Every puzzle you've solved, and every story you've read, will be relevant information that will be used in the upcoming campaign. So, for those who participated, thank you for taking interest in this project and following along with the lore. Should you choose to participate in the campaign, I will have rewards for those who were involved over the past 5 months. So again, thank you for giving this story the start it needed, and thank you for those who were actively archiving in the "Soothsayer Scribes" channel. This wouldn't be possible without you. </p>
	  <p>Now, to explain the countdown.</p>
	  <p>Originally, the countdown was set for May 10th, 2026. As some of you pointed out, this was the same day as my originally intented graduation day. On that day, I was planning on having the campaign's first session. As I come to find out, this date did not work out in the long run, and is going to be pushed back to around mid-to-late July. Though, through you all solving puzzles, the date was "corrected" and pushed to a month before May 10th, aka April 10th. This was to designate a session zero, that would introduce everyone to the world, as well as give them a chance to create their characters, and allow them to plan for the campaign's start on the 10th of May.</p>
	  <p>Now, as you can obviously tell, the countdown was changed from the 10th of April, to today, January 31st. I made the decision to announce the campaign earlier than intended due to my increasingly busy schedule, and my inability to keep up with the daily countdown through the Soothsayer, aka Reice Richter. I feel I was able to have a strong start with his story, but creating puzzles and lore throughout what is the most busy and complicated time in my life began to become unsustainable. It was definitely a lot of fun, and I am so glad to have such an amazing group of participants, but my biggest priorities are to finish my degree and get the fuck out of college before I lose my mind, and I felt this had to end earlier than anticipated.</p>
	  <p>This being said, this campaign is absolutely still happening, and I have a lot of great ideas that I think will excite a lot of people here. For those who have known me for many years, you will know that it's been about 8 years since I've regularly participated in any D&D campaigns. I still remember going over to Owen's and Kevan's houses to run in their respective campaigns back in 2018 after high school, and those were some of the greatest memories I will ever cherish. I sincerely miss D&D, but as school picked up, and my life started to accelerate, I had to put my career first, and so I took a long, long break.</p>
	  <p>But now that my schooling is coming to an end, I felt it's time to make my return to D&D. Soon, I'll hopefully be able to join you all in your own campaigns, but I figured if I'm going to get back into it, why not run my own?</p>
	  <p>For now, the soft date I have set for session zero will be around or on May 10, 2026. This will be where we create our characters in preparation for our first session taking place around July 24th of this year.</p>
	  <p>All of these dates are subject to change, but for reference, session zero will take place around the end of UNT's spring semester, and session one will take place on my final day at UNT. I plan to host session zero fully online, but if you all would like to join me in-person for session one, we will be celebrating the closing of this chapter of my life, and opening the door to a new future(s?).</p>
	  <p>So once again, thank you to all who have been, and will be participating in this campaign, I sincerely hope you come to love it, and thank you to the individuals who have helped me throughout the last 10 years. You're the greatest friends I could ask for, and I'm excited for the next 10. Much love <3 </p>
